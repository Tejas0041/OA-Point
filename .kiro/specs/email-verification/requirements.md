# Email Verification for Registration - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements email verification during the user registration process to ensure that users provide valid email addresses and prevent spam registrations. Users must verify their email address before they can complete the signup process and access the platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Email Verification UI

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to verify my email address during registration, so that I can prove I own the email address and complete my account creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters an email address in the registration form THEN the system SHALL display a "Verify Email" button next to the email field
2. WHEN a user clicks the "Verify Email" button THEN the system SHALL send a verification code to the provided email address
3. WHEN the verification email is sent THEN the system SHALL display a verification code input field
4. WHEN a user enters the correct verification code THEN the system SHALL mark the email as verified and enable the registration form submission
5. WHEN a user enters an incorrect verification code THEN the system SHALL display an error message and keep the form disabled
6. WHEN the email is not verified THEN the system SHALL disable the "Create Account" button

### Requirement 2: Email Verification Backend

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to handle email verification securely, so that only users with valid email addresses can register.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a verification request is received THEN the system SHALL generate a 6-digit random verification code
2. WHEN a verification code is generated THEN the system SHALL store it temporarily with a 10-minute expiration time
3. WHEN a verification email is sent THEN the system SHALL use the existing email infrastructure with OA Point branding
4. WHEN a verification code is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate it against the stored code and email
5. WHEN a verification code expires THEN the system SHALL allow the user to request a new code
6. WHEN a user attempts to register without email verification THEN the system SHALL reject the registration

### Requirement 3: Email Template for Verification

**User Story:** As a user receiving a verification email, I want a clear and professional email with the verification code, so that I can easily complete the verification process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a verification email is sent THEN the email SHALL use the OA Point branding and logo
2. WHEN the verification email is composed THEN it SHALL include the 6-digit verification code prominently
3. WHEN the verification email is sent THEN it SHALL include clear instructions on how to use the code
4. WHEN the verification email is sent THEN it SHALL include the expiration time (10 minutes)
5. WHEN the verification email is sent THEN it SHALL include a note about not sharing the code

### Requirement 4: Rate Limiting and Security

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to prevent abuse of the email verification system, so that the service remains available and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests email verification THEN the system SHALL limit requests to 1 per minute per email address
2. WHEN a user makes too many verification requests THEN the system SHALL display a rate limit message
3. WHEN a verification code is generated THEN it SHALL be cryptographically secure and unpredictable
4. WHEN verification attempts fail 5 times THEN the system SHALL temporarily block further attempts for that email
5. WHEN a verification code is used successfully THEN the system SHALL invalidate it immediately

### Requirement 5: User Experience Enhancements

**User Story:** As a user going through registration, I want clear feedback and guidance during email verification, so that I can complete the process without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the verification email is being sent THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
2. WHEN the verification email is sent successfully THEN the system SHALL show a success message with instructions
3. WHEN there's an error sending the email THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with retry option
4. WHEN the verification code input is shown THEN it SHALL have proper formatting (6-digit input with spacing)
5. WHEN the email is verified successfully THEN the system SHALL show a green checkmark and success message
6. WHEN the user wants to change their email THEN the system SHALL allow editing and require re-verification

## Technical Considerations

- Use existing nodemailer infrastructure for sending emails
- Store verification codes in memory or Redis with TTL (time-to-live)
- Implement proper error handling for email delivery failures
- Ensure verification codes are case-insensitive
- Add proper loading states and user feedback
- Maintain existing registration form validation
- Ensure mobile-responsive design for verification UI

## Success Criteria

- Users cannot complete registration without email verification
- Verification emails are delivered reliably within 30 seconds
- Verification codes expire after 10 minutes
- Rate limiting prevents abuse while allowing legitimate use
- User interface provides clear guidance throughout the process
- Integration with existing authentication system is seamless
